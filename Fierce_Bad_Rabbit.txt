This is a fierce bad Rabbit; look at his savage whiskers, his claws, and his turned-up tail. In contrast, there is a nice gentle Rabbit, whose mother has given him a carrot. The nice bunny is sitting on a bench, when the bad rabbit approaches, standing on the bench and leaning over the good rabbit. The bad Rabbit wants some carrot but doesn't say "Please." Instead, he takes the carrot and pushes the gentle rabbit, scratching him very badly. The good Rabbit, feeling sad, creeps away and hides in a hole.

A man with a gun appears, walking nearby. He sees something sitting on a bench and thinks it is a very funny bird. As he comes creeping up behind the trees, he shoots—Bang! A swirl of ears, carrot, and a fluffy tail follows. When the hunter rushes up to the bench, he finds only a carrot and a fluffy tail on it. The good Rabbit peeps out of its hole and sees the bad Rabbit tearing past—without any tail or whiskers!
